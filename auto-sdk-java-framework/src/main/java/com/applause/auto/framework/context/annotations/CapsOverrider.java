/**
 * This annotation allows for specification of a Capability Override function. It should be
 * annotated on a method in the same test class that will use the override. This is not a required
 * annotation, but will allow you to inject custom capabilities at runtime through Java code.
 *
 * <p>This expects that the function is static and will take in a single Capabilities object and
 * return a MutableCapabilities. IF the annotated function does not meet these criteria, it will not
 * be invoked.
 *
 * <p>The system does support multiple CapsOverride annotations in a single test class. To choose
 * which one should be used for a @Test, you can specify the @WithCapsOverride annotation with a
 * value matching the value provided in this annotation.
